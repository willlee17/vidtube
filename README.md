# VidTube Repository
## Technologies / Functionalities
#### I created a simple YouTube clone using JavaScript, React, React Router, Bootstrap, and Heroku. Using YouTube's API and React Router, I was able to create routes that contained video details that loaded the corresponding page with the correct video and details. Lifecycle methods were also a huge part of calling functions immediately as certain components loaded.

## Stage
#### The site is deployed and hosted using Heroku. Feel free to check it out here: [VidTube](https://vidtube-willlee17.herokuapp.com/)

## Improvements
* Add better and more descriptive comments, so it's easier to get back into the workflow from where I left off
* Adopt better CSS practices. Too many styles overwriting each other
* Improve UX by loading images faster. Things still look choppy. Consider lazy loading images as the user enters the site.
